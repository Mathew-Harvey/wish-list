## Description 🧐
We wanted to build an application to collect wishlists in a user account. 
## Motivation 🚀
My wife asked, what do you want for your birthday. I responded with 3 x facebook msgs and 1 x text message. Months later she asked, what do you want for christmas? Again, a series of texts and msgs and emails. Something had to change. Enter - The Wishlist App.
